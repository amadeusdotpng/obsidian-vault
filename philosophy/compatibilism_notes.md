# Intro
Compatibilism is the belief that free will and determinism are able to coexist without logical inconsistencies. The opposite belief is called _incompatibilism_.

"I would say that free will is nothing but out conscious experience of deciding what to do, which I know I am experiencing as I write this review, and this experience is not invalidated by the reflection that physical laws made it inevitable that I would want to make these decisions." - Steven Weinberg ([Paragraph 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism))

"Compatibilists believe that freedom can be present or absent in situations for reasons that have nothing to do with metaphysics." ([Paragraph 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism))

Metaphysics is basically the study of the structure of our reality.

# History
- Ancient Stoics in Greece and Rome were one of the first to mention + champion the concept of compatibilism.

- Medieval scholastics like Thomas Aquinas and Thomists also believed in compatibilism.

- "Aquinas is often interpreted to maintain rational compatibilism" ([Paragraph 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism#History))

- Rational Compatibilism believes that "an action can be determined by rational cognition and yet free." ([Paragraph 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism#History))

- Theological determinism, developed by the Thomists, is determined by the divine decrees of god.

# [Frankfurt Counterexamples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_cases)
Presented by Harry Frankfurt in 1969 as counterexamples to the principle of alternate possibilities.

## Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP)
This principle states that a person is only morally responsible for they have done if they could have done something else other than what they've did. This is mainly used to argue for incompatibilism by the following argument:
1. PAP: An agent is responsible for an action only if said agent could have done otherwise.
2. An agent could have done otherwise only if causal determinism false.
3. Therefore, an agent is responsible for an action only if causal determinism is false.

## Frankfurt's Objection

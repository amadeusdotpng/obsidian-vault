# Fatalism

## Logical Fatalism

## Theological Fatalism
Nelson Pike is credited for developing theological fatalism. It basically argues that divine omniscience is incompatible with free will.

### The Argument
The way Pike argues for this incompatibility is by supposing that being omniscient is infallible. Formally, the [proposition](math/logic/propositions) $p$ is only believed if and only if $p$ is true. The argument then follows

1. Suppose God is an omniscient being.
2. God knows choice $C$ that a human would claim to choose "freely".
3. It is now necessary that $C$.
4. If $C$ is now necessary, then $C$ cannot be otherwise.
5. If one cannot do otherwise when one acts, then one does not act "freely" (Principle of Alternate Possibilities).
6. Therefore, $C$ was not chosen "freely".

### Responses and Resolutions
- Redefining free will as "freedom from coercion".
- Omniscience does not imply knowing what choice one would make. It only implies knowing what would happen given some choice.
- The argument

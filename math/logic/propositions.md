# Propositions
Propositions are statements that hold a truth value, usually true or false in classical models of logic. Propositions can also be modeled as functions that map possible worlds to a truth value.

## Examples of Propositions
The statement "the sky is blue" is an example of a proposition since it holds some truth value of whether or not the sky is blue.

The statement "get me a pizza" is not a proposition since it does not hold some truth value about some subject. It is simply a command.

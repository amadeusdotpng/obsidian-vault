## Chapter 1

**Psychology: What is the textbook definition?**  
The scientific study of mind and behavior.

**What's the difference between Psychology and Pseudoscience?**  
*Psychology* is based on empirical evidence and the scientific method while *pseudoscience* are beliefs or practices that are mistakenly thought to be based on valid science.

**What are the different perspectives in psychology?**  
- *Evolutionary*: The evolutionary perspective seeks to identify behavior that was a result from evolutionary adaptation. It also seeks how evolution has shaped certain cultural universals that all human beings share, such as the preference for fairness.

- *Cultural*: The cultural perspective seeks to understand how cultural context affects people's thoughts and preferences.
    - *Culture* refers to the rules, values, customs, and beliefs that exist within a group of people who share a common language and environment.
    
- *Cognitive*: The cognitive perspective studies the mental processes that underlie perception, thought, learning, memory, language, and creativity.

- *Emotional*: The emotional perspective seeks to understand how the human capacity to feel, express, and perceive emotions plays an important role in decision making, behavior, and social relationships.

- *Biological*: The biological-neuroscience perspective seeks to understand the biological underpinnings of how we think, feel, and behave.
    - *Neuroscience* is the scientific study of how nerves and cells send and receive the information from the brain, body, and spinal cord.
    
- *Developmental*: The developmental perspective seeks to understand how humans change physically, cognitively, socially, and emotionally as they age.

- *Personality*: The personality perspective seeks to understand aspects of human behavior that are **relatively stable** over time and situation.

- *Social*: The social perspective studies how **immediate** social contexts influence thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are **independent** of personalities.

- *Clinical*: The clinical perspective focuses on the causes and treatment of psychological disorders, with the goal of improving human well-being, daily functioning, and social relationships.

**What is positive psychology? What is happiness?**  
*Positive psychology* focuses on the factors that make people happy, healthy, and stress-free. It includes the study of important human experiences, such as hope, courage, and creativity.

Psychologists believe that *happiness* has three main components:
- Positive emotion and pleasure
- Engagement with life
- Living a meaningful life with good relationships and a history of accomplishment

**What does the WEIRD acronym stand for?**  
It stands for:

**W**estern, **E**ducated, **I**ndustrialized, **R**ich, and **D**emocratic.  
 
 It represents the majority of research participants that the existing knowledge base in psychology is based on, meaning there is a slight bias in psychology on these characteristics.
 
 Psychological studies may have much different results in eastern countries in comparison to western ones.

**What is the overconfidence effect?**  
The overconfidence effect is the tendency to be overly sure of what we know, making us unreasonably confident that our own intuitions are more correct than consistent results of actual research studies.

*Confirmation bias* is the tendency to seek out, pay attention to, and believe only the evidence that already supports beliefs that we are confident or want to believe in.

**How do you learn to think critically in psychology? What types of things does critical thinking involve?**
Critical thinking is a purposeful, reasoned, and goal-directed process of exploring a situation or problem. It involves examining evidence and formulating reasonable and accurate conclusions.

Basically, don't be stupid, seek evidence and analyze it. Don't believe  everything that someone tells you without trying to get sources and thinking about it.

You can ask three questions to become better at evaluating claims.
- What scientific evidence supports this claim?
- Has this topic been studied empirically?
- Am I listening to (or reading) someone's opinion, or is the information based on facts that are accepted by unbiased experts?

## Chapter 2

**What are the issues associated with relying on intuition and experience rather than empirical evidence when seeking to understand a psychological phenomenon?**  
Intuition, experience and "common sense" can go against what actual empirical evidence suggests. Our intuition and experience are full of biases that we may or may not be aware of. Empirical evidence should always be used when seeking to understand psychological phenomenons.

**What are the types of research?**  
- *Descriptive Research*: A type of study in which researchers measure one variable at a time
    - *Surveys*: It is a type of descriptive research that uses self-reporting from a *sample* of people of a certain *population of interest*. Survey research provides concise summaries of a lot of people.
    - *Observational Research*: A descriptive research method in which psychologists measure their variable of interest by observing and recording what people are doing.
        - *Naturalistic Observation*: An observational research method in which psychologists observe the behavior of animals and people in their normal, everyday worlds and environments. Researchers do not interfere with the usual behavior of those being observed.
        - *Case Study*: An observational research method in which researchers study one or two individuals in-depth, often those who have a unique condition.
- *Correlational Research*: A type of study that measures two (or more) variables in the same sample of people, and observes the relationship between them.
    - A correlation is **positive** if high values in one variable go with high values on the other.
    - A correlation is **negative** if high values in one variable go with low values on the other.
    - If a correlation is zero, values of one variable are no systematically related to values of the other variable.
    - If the variables are tightly coupled together, the *strength* of the correlational relationship is **strong** while if they are spread out, is **weak**.
    - You can visualize the relationship of the data points with a scatter plot.
    - A weakness of correlational research is that it **cannot** establish causality as it is impossible to always rule out some *confounds*, also called the *third variable problem*. To establish causality, an *experimental research* must be done.
        - A *confound* is an alternative explanation for a relationship between two variables.
        - An example of the *third variable problem* is that cities with more fire hydrants tend to have more dogs. These two variables are highly correlated, however they do not cause each other.  
          The third variable that causes both variables is population size. Cities with a higher population will tend to have more fire hydrants and more dogs.
- *Experimental Research*: A study in which one variable is manipulated, and the other is measured. Experimental research can provide evidence that one variable causes another.

**What are independent and dependent variables?**  
Independent variables are the variables in an experimental research that is **manipulated** while dependent variables are the variables that are **measured**.

**What is a sample and a population of interest?**  
The group who participated in research, and who belong to the larger group (the population of interest) that the researcher is interested in understanding.

The population of interest is the larger set of individuals (or cases) the researcher is interested in.

It's important to have good *sampling methods* to ensure that the sample does not misrepresent the population of interest that is being generalized to.

**What are good sampling methods? What is random assignment?**
Random sampling, also known as random selection, is a method of choosing participants for a study in which participants are chosen without bias. There's some particular methods of random sampling such as simple random sampling and stratified random sampling, but we won't get into that here.

Bad sampling methods such as *convenience sampling* and *voluntary response sampling* chooses participants in a biased manner. 

An example for convenience sampling is surveying the first few people in a line for a hockey game how excited they are. It's convenient, but also chooses members who are probably the ones that are the most excited.

An example of voluntary sampling is a tv show host asking its viewers to respond to an online poll. It is voluntary to respond, however people who would bother responding will most likely have stronger opinions that those who are indifferent and thus not bother responding.

Random assignment is used only in experiments. It's the method used to assign participants to the different levels of the independent variable.

**What were the variables in the Giancola et al. (2012) study about the effects of alcohol on aggression? How was this study designed and executed?**  
The independent variable was the person's alcohol level and the dependent variable was their aggression. The researchers recruited 518 people who were "social drinkers" from a newspaper ads.

The researchers operationalized the independent variable by flipping a coin to assign each participant to one of two conditions: "high alcohol", enough to make the participants legally drunk, and "expected alcohol."

The researchers operationalized the dependent variable by making the participants play a game against a fictitious opponent where the winner could deliver a punishment to the loser through an electric shock, from mild to severe.

**What is the scientific method (theory-data cycle)?**
The scientific method is a way of testing hypotheses and theories through scientific experiments and empirical data. The theory-data cycle is the process in which scientists collect data that can either confirm or disconfirm a theory.

**What are the types of validity?**
- *Construct Validity*: How well the variables that were operationalized captures the phenomenon we are trying to study.
- *External Validity*: How well the sample used for the study represents the larger population, or how well can the results from the sample be generalized to the larger population.
- *Internal Validity*: How well a study can establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The degree of confidence we have that the results are tied to the manipulation of the independent variable rather than some confounding variable.

**What are operational definitions of variables? For which type of validity is it important?**  
Operational definition is the specific way of measuring and manipulating an abstract variable in a particular study. For example, in the alcohol study, the researchers operationalized aggression through the severity of the electric shock the participant would send to their opponent. This is important to construct validity.

**What are the 3 core principles for human research?**  
- *Autonomy*: Participants has the right, without intimidation or coercion, to decide about participating in the research.
    - An application of autonomy is *informed consent* where the participant is informed about the procedures of the research, including its risks and potential benefits.
- *Beneficence*: the benefits of the research must outweigh the risks.
- *Justice*: Research should not be conducted disproportionately on one segment of the population. Participants bearing the burden of the research must be representative of the people who will benefit from the research.

**What are the 3 guiding principles of animal research (3 R's)?**  
- *Replacement*: Researchers should find alternatives to using animals in research when possible. For example, some studies can use computer simulations instead of animal subjects.
- *Refinement*: Researchers should modify experimental procedures and other aspects of animal care to minimize or eliminate animal distress.
- *Reduction*: Researchers should adopt experimental designs and procedures that require the fewest animal subjects possible.

**What is descriptive statistics?**  
Graphs or computations that describe the characteristics of a batch of scores, such as its distribution, central tendency, or variability.

**What is inferential statistics?**  
A set of procedures used to estimate whether a pattern of results represents a true relationship or difference in the population.

## Chapter 3

**What are neurons?**
Neurons are the cellular building blocks of the brain. They fire electrical signals and stuff.

**What are the three main types of neurons?**
- *Motor Neurons*: Neurons that sends signals to make the body take action, enabling you to interact with your environment.
- *Sensory Neurons*: A neuron that carries information from the outside world and within the body to the brain.
- *Interneurons*: The rest of the neurons that are in between, connecting other neurons. They interpret, store, and retrieve information about the world. Most of your brain's resources are devoted to processing the immense amount of sensory data it receives and using that data to plan and execute future actions.

Motor neurons and sensory neurons make up only a tiny fraction of the billions of neurons in your brain.

**What is Top-down and Bottom-up processing?**  
Top-down processing refers to the brain processing sensory information (top) and sending signals to the body for motor actions (down).

Bottom-up processing refers to the body receiving sensory stimuli (bottom) and sending signals to the brain to process those stimuli (up).

**What are the parts of the nervous system?**
- *Central Nervous System (CMS)*: The system composed of the brain and spinal cord; information from your body travels to the brain by way of the nerves of your spinal cord. This connects to the PNS.
- *Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)*: The system composed of the sensory and motor nerves that travel throughout the entire body. It is divided into two parts.
    - *Somatic Nervous System (SNS)*: The system that allows us to feel external sensations from and control volitional movement of the body.
    - *Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)*: The system that allows you to feel internal sensations like your stomach grumbling. The ANS is further divided into two parts.
        - *Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)*: A division of the autonomic nervous system that acts on blood vessels, organs, and glands in ways that prepare the body for action, especially in life-threatening situations. Fight-or-flight.
        - *Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)*: A division of the autonomic nervous system that returns the body to a resting state by counteracting the actions of the sympathetic system.

**What is the Endocrine System?**  
The endocrine system is a network of *glands* that produces and releases *hormones* into the bloodstream to regulate the body's activities.

*Hormones* are blood-borne chemicals that travel through the circulatory system enabling the brain to regulate the body's activities.

There are several different glands in the body:
- *Adrenal Glands*: It is located on top of the kidneys. They are known for their role in the flight-or-flight response and thus are activated by the **Sympathetic Nervous System**, a branch of the **Autonomic Nervous System**.
    - Adrenal glands release two stress hormones: *adrenaline* and *cortisol*. It boosts your energy and increase your heart rate.
- *Pituitary Gland*: The master endocrine gland, located at the base of the brain, that in addition to producing its own hormones, regulates hormone production in other glands
    - It is associated with modulating hunger, sexual arousal, and sleep.
    - It also produces sex hormones such as *testosterone* and *estrogen*, influencing growth, sexual development, and brain development.
    - Another hormone, *oxytocin*, is produced by the pituitary which plays a role in interpersonal trust, romantic love, and reproductive functions related to giving birth.
    
**What are the parts of the brain?**  
The brain is divided into two hemispheres. Each hemisphere is split into four major developmental divisions, which are further divided into structures that are responsible for different functions.
- *Forebrain (Neocortex)*: The neocortex is evolutionarily the newest cerebral cortex that is the largest part of the human brain. It supports complex functions, including language, thought, problem solving, and imagination. It is divided into five *lobes*.
    - *Frontal Lobe*: Located in the front of the head. It contains the primary motor cortex and map of the body's muscles. It is essential for movement and planning.
        - The frontal lobe also contains the *prefrontal cortex* which is responsible for thought, planing, decision making, and self-control. This is what is thought to make you, *you*.
    - *Parietal Lobe*: It contains the primary somatosensory cortex, making it responsible for sensory inputs as well as spatial awareness. It has a map of the body skin surface and sense of touch. It runs alongside the head above and behind the ears.
    - *Occipital Lobe*: It contains the primary visual cortex making it responsible for vision. It runs along the back portion of the head.
    - *Temporal Lobe*: It contains the primary auditory cortex, making it responsible for the ability to hear and understand language as well as person and object recognition. It runs alongside the ears.
    - *Insular Lobe*: It contains the primary taste cortex, making it responsible for the sense of taste. It also allows the perception of internal organs. It insulated by the overlying cortex.
- *Limbic System*: A system often associated with emotion; it bridges the older, lower brain regions that regulate the body with the newer, higher brain structures more related to complex mental functions. It is divided into different parts.
    - *Hippocampus*: It is crucial for aspects of memory, the ability to navigate the environment, and the ability to think about the future as well as the past, especially emotionally prominent ones. It is located in the inner part of the temporal lobe.
    - *Amygdala*: Responsible for registering the emotional significance of events. It is crucial for fear, stress, and anxiety. It also projects to many regions of the brain, influencing thoughts, decision making, and memory. It is located just to the inside of the end of the hippocampus.
        - Almond-shaped structure.
    - *Basal Ganglia*: A group of interconnected structures that are an evolutionarily older subcortical motor system. Necessary for planning and executing movement.
    - *Thalamus*: A subcortical structure deep in the middle of the brain. It communicates information to and from all of the sensory systems except the olfactory (smell) system. It regulates alertness and consciousness.
    - *Hypothalamus*: The master of hte brain and body; integrates bodily signals with their associated feelings and behaviors.
        - It regulates specific functions such as hunger, body rhythms, reward seeking behavior, and aggression.
- *Brainstem*: The lowest region of the brain; it sits on top of and is continuous with the spinal cord.
    - Collects sensory signals from the body.
    - Sends signals down from the brain to create movement and regulate vital functions.
- *Midbrain*: An upper brain structure that serves as a crucial relay station for motor and sensory pathways.
    - It also plays a role in arousal and pain modulation.
    - Critical for **motivation and reward**.
- *Pons*: An upper brain structure that **controls breathing** and relays sensations
- *Medulla*: A lower brainstem structure that controls the autonomic functions including:
    - Heart rate
    - Blood pressure
    - Reflexes like coughing and swallowing
- *Reticular formation*: contained by the pons and medulla, it runs through the brainstem and is connected to many parts of the brain.
    - Plays a central role in arousal and attention
    - Keeps us high alert during danger
    - Regulates sleep and wakefulness
    - Plays a role in ADHD
- *Cerebellum*: A hindbrain structure located behind the pons and medulla; part of the brain rather than the brainstem. It supports a variety of functions including:
    - coordination
    - precision
    - balance
    - accurate timing
- *Corpus Callosum*: The bridge of fibers that connects the two halves of the brain. This allows the two halves of the brain to share information and support the *contralateral*.

**What is contralateral communication?**  
Contralateral communication is the opposite-side organization of the brain, whereby one side of the body is connected to and controlled by the opposite brain hemisphere.

For example, if a person stubs their left toe, the sensory information is sent to the right hemisphere of hte brain.


**What is the basic structure of a neuron?**  
All neurons have the same basic parts:
- *Dendrite*: The part of the neuron that receives chemical messages from other neurons
- *Cell Body*: The part of the neuron that collects neural impulse. It contains the nucleus and provides life-sustaining functions for the cell
- *Axon*: The part of the neuron that transports electrical impulses to other neurons via the *terminal branches*
- *Terminal Branch*: The part of the neuron that converts electrical signals into chemical messages to other neurons.

**What are the three classes of neurotransmitters?**   
Neurotransmitters are the chemical messengers released at the *terminal branch* to allow communication between neurons.
- Amino acids
- Monoamines
- Acetylcholine

**What are the types of support cells in the brain?**  
*Glia* cells make up the *myelin sheath* around neurons to insulate, support, and nourish neurons and modulate neuronal function.
- It is responsible for vacuuming up neuronal debris.
- Serves as cellular glue between neurons, giving the brain its jelly-like consistency.
- Contributes to information processing during childhood development and into adulthood
- Essential for brain development

The *myelin sheath* is a layer of fatty tissue that covers and insulates an axon to ensure that electrical messages travel fast and meet less resistance.
- Gives white matter its light colored appearance
- Critcal for normal human brain development
- Increased speed of electrical signal within the neuron.

**What is action potential?**  
Action potential is when a neuron fires an electrical impulse down the axon when they have been successfully stimulated.

**What is the synapse?**  
The synapse is the gap where a sending neuron communicates with the dendrites or cell body of the receiving neuron.

**What is epigenetics?**  
Epigenetics is the study of how the interactions between your genes and environment regulate your gene expression. Basically your environment can affect your gene expression.
